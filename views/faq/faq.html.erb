Each component is an activity. Note that this applies to a large subset of FCDO data, but not to all of it, and not to the data published by other government departments.</p>

          <h3>Sector, sector group</h3>
          <p>The sector of a contribution answers the question “which specific area of the recipient's economic or social structure is the transfer intended to foster”. A project can have up to multiple Sectors, which are displayed with percentage allocations that total up to 100%. A Sector Group is a grouping of like Sectors. A search on any selected Sector Group / Sector will bring back all projects that work within the relevant Sector criteria specified, regardless of size of the allocation.</p>
          <p>If a Sector group and Sector are chosen as filters, the search will only return results if the project contains both the sector group and the sector. We do not currently display the Sector group/sector hierarchy on the search pages and are looking at this for a future release.</p>
          <p>Note: The sector names presented here are fully consistent with the DAC sector classifications. However, as explained above the sectors published on this website are based on a multisectoral approach. In contrast, when donors report to the DAC, only one sector is reporterd per project component (i.e. the one with the highest percentage). This is in line with DAC guidelines and ensures that all donors report consistently.</p>

          <h3>Special conditions attached to funding</h3>
          <p>FCDO has been publishing conditions documents since April 2010. A condition is an action, circumstance or situation which is required for committed aid to be disbursed. If a condition is not fulfilled it could lead to payments being delayed or suspended. Transparent conditions are essential for accountability to the UK Parliament and public, ensuring that aid is used effectively and for the purposes intended. Making conditions transparent is also important to support country ownership and strengthen domestic accountability of developing country governments to their people and parliaments. This field shows whether or not the project has any specific conditions attached to the pledge of aid. Note that as of January 2006, all project documents contain details of conditions under conditionality section 5.</p>

            <h3>What's it for</h3>
            <p>These values are types of aid funding with a focus on who first receives the funds (excluding payment through Crown Agents Bank). Note that this section was written specifically for the business and operations of the Department for International Development (DFID), prior to the creation of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). It was also written before DevTracker incorporated data published by other government departments. As such, it should be instructive of the ODA still carried out by FCDO, but not representative of all data published through DevTracker. References to DFID have been kept reflecting this.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>Budget Support</h3>
                <p>Budget support considers both General Budget Support (GBS) and Sector Budget Support (SBS). GBS is a general contribution to the overall budget. It aims to help implement the government's poverty reduction strategy in order to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.The funds flow directly to partner governments and are pooled with their own funds. DFID funds cannot be identified separately from partner government funds so cannot be easily allocated to sectors. DFID uses a standardized methodology to notionally allocate GBS to sectors in the same proportions as the recipient Government allocated total resources to ODA (Official Development Assistance) eligible activity i.e. if a government intends to spend 25% of its budget on education,25% of GBS provided would be attributed to education. SBS is a contribution to the overall budget which primarily aims to achieve objectives within a particular sector either at national or sub national level. The SBS may be earmarked and may be transferred to a sector specific bank account over which government has financial authority. Where budget support is provided to a sub-national level of government to achieve a range of sector impacts it will be classified as SBS.</p>

                <h3>Development bank replenishment </h3>
                <p>Development Bank replenishments (or 'promissory notes') are a way of funding multilateral organisations where DFID 'deposits' funds with the Bank of England. Multilateral organisations then 'encash' these funds as they need them. On this website, you will see the deposits of these amounts, this is consistent with how DFID reports internationally to the OECD DAC.</p>

                <h3>Emergency aid</h3>
                <p>Until recently all Humanitarian Assistance fell under Emergency Aid, however in order to report more effectively it has been decided that Emergency Aid is only allocated to projects that are classified as Emergency situations only, which result from man-made crises or natural disasters e.g.

              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Emergency food aid</h3>
                <p>Food aid normally to general free distribution or special supplementary feeding programmes; short term relief to targeted population groups affected by emergency situations. This excludes non-emergency food security assistance programmes/food aid.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Material relief assistance and service</h3>
                <p>Shelter, water, sanitation and health services, supply of medicines and other non-food relief items, assistance to refugees and internally displaced people in developing countries other than for food or protection.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Multilateral organisation</h3>
                <p>Multilateral organisations can receive the following types of contributions:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Core compulsory contributions - These are contributions which must be paid under certain agreements usually international.</li>
                  <li>Core voluntary contributions - These are contributions which are not legally required to be paid but are voluntary given to contribute to regular or non project specific costs of an institution.</li>
                  <li>Non core voluntary contributions - Are multilateral contributions which have a specific objective in mind, such as capacity building for the organisation, the provision of secondees to the multilateral organisation or support to individual country programmes.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Not for profit organisation </h3>
                <p>Grant to 'not for profit' organisations such as to NGO's and Civil Society (excluding contracts awarded to 'not for profit' organisations), for example:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Accountable Grants</li>
                  <li>Challenge Fund</li>

                  <li>Other bilateral donor</li>
                  <li>Partnership Programme Arrangements (PPA)</li>
                  <li>Strategic Grants</li>
                </ol>
                <p>DFID can provide finance to other donors for shared development purposes, ways of working include Joint Programmes and Basket Funds, although this value is only used when DFID is working with another bilateral donor and the project does not fit into any of the other bilateral nature of funding types.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Other financial aid to government</h3>
                <p>capital of the recipient country including local and recurrent costs. A project can be identifiable as having ‘Other financial aid to government' funding if any of the four following issues can be identifiable:
                Detailed specification about what the funds can be used for. Detailed means below sub sector level and identifying budget heads or sub heads, goods or services. 
                Use of aid can be identified independently of other resources in the government's budget through the use of detailed account codes or by tracking to the level of goods or services it purchases. 
                The partner government can account for how the resources have been used by providing a separate Annual Audited Statement confirming that DFID's resources were used as intended. If necessary, DFID may use another independent audit process to obtain assurance about the annual statement of account produced by the partner government. 
                Funds are reimbursed on receipt of evidence of expenditure on eligible terms. </p>
              </li>

                <h3>Procurement of goods</h3>

              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Relief co-ordination; protection and support services</h3>
                <p>Measures to co-ordinate delivery of emergency humanitarian aid, including logistics and communications systems; measures to promote and protect the safety, wellbeing, dignity and integrity of civilians and those no longer taking part in hostilities) Non-emergency food security assistance programmes/food aid and reconstruction relief and rehabilitation do NOT belong here; instead they are treated like any other bilateral/multilateral project, with the relevant sector group and sector information. </p>
