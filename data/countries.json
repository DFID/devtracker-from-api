While progress has been made over the last decade, Afghanistan has a long way to go to achieve the MDGs and has agreed a 5 year extension until 2020. DFID’s vision is for a more peaceful, stable, viable and prosperous Afghanistan. In support of this, the UK has committed to maintain current levels of assistance (£178 million per year) until at least 2017.   ## Top priorities * supporting peace, security and political stability  * promoting economic stability, growth and jobs * helping the state to deliver improved services * supporting women and girls  ## Further resources [DFID Operational Plan for Afghanistan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-afghanistan-operational-plan-2014)  [Afghanistan page on Gov.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/afghanistan)",

    "description": "The twin island country of Antigua and Barbuda is located in the eastern Caribbean and has a population of around 90,000. The economy depends mainly on tourism and offshore banking, both of which are vulnerable to shocks such as an economic crisis or natural disaster.  In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015. As part of this, Antigua and Barbuda will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters. Most people in the Caribbean live close to the coast, vulnerable to the threats of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. UK aid will provide training at community level through the Red Cross in Antigua, as well as practical measures such as safer buildings, improved water management and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.  \"  We are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions.  Knowing what problems they face will make it easier for them to make a case for action, mobilise resources to scale up their efforts and ensure development gains are not lost.  In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:  £10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets  £10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union.  CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors  £4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.  In Antigua and Barbuda, COMPETE is financing the cost of a plan to make the private sector more competitive. It is also making trade easier through customs reforms, and is encouraging private sector development by reducing the cost and time to pay taxes. Under CARTFund, we are helping public agencies put legislation in place to implement the trade agreement with Europe, as well as helping the private sector to understand the agreement so that they can capitalise on opportunities to export more to Europe and get more investment  The Antigua and Barbuda financial sector also benefits from DFID's £600,000 contribution to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, to help it regulate the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.   Antigua and Barbuda is heavily indebted, a situation which grew worse in the 2008 financial crisis. Since 1997, DFID has provided £1.69 million in debt relief under the UK's Commonwealth Debt Initiative.  In common with the rest of the Caribbean, Antigua and Barbuda suffers from the effects of organised crime. We are training and equipping law enforcement agencies, courts and special intelligence units across the Eastern Caribbean to investigate organised crime, confiscate criminal assets and reduce money laundering.  The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited Antigua and Barbuda amounted to £476,000.",

What has been achieved is significant and, with our bilateral programme ending in February 2011, we are proud to have played a part.  Much has changed during the 17 years since DFID first provided support. The country's progress from a post-conflict situation to a potential EU candidate country has been impressive, particularly in the light of its complex political structure.  Although DFID activities are ending, this is by no means the end of the UK's support. The British Embassy remains and UK funding will continue to reach Bosnia and Herzegovina through the EU and other multilateral agencies – some 15% of the money the EU spends in Bosnia and Herzegovina is from the UK. Through our Embassy, the UK will work closely with those organisations to ensure support remains focused on helping Bosnia and Herzegovina on the road to EU membership.",

    "description": "Brazil is the eighth largest economy in the world and is expected to rise to fourth largest by 2050.  It has an increasingly assertive foreign policy, is a key member of the World Trade Organisation, the G20, the G77, the Non Aligned Movement, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and IBSA (India, Brazil and South Africa) groups and is a leading candidate for permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council.  Brazil and UK share many common views on trade liberalisation, poverty and inclusive growth, climate change and multilateralism. Brazil has taken a wider role on global security and already plays a strong stabilisation role in the Latin American region.  Brazil is on course for achieving the MDGs. It has lifted nearly 20 million Brazilians out of poverty in the last decade and its famed Condition Cash Transfer programme Bolsa Familia benefits a quarter of Brazil’s population making it one of the most effective social programmes of its kind.  DFID is working in partnership with Brazil to promote development and poverty reduction globally. DFID has no programme inside Brazil itself.  Together we aim to have a positive impact on global issues such as growth and trade, conflict and security, climate change and sustainable development.  We focus on areas where Brazil has strong domestic experience and expertise which is well matched to in-country demand.  We are also working to strengthen our partnership with Brazil to shape and deliver the development agenda in international processes - in the G20, Doha and the UN.  Working in partnership with Brazil on its distinctive south-south approach to development cooperation has real potential to open up different routes to address development challenges and opportunities for impact.  Its domestic success in poverty reduction, food security, maternal and child health, social protection, low carbon development and climate change mitigation, as well as its methods to achieve results make Brazil a highly credible development partner.  As a result, its skills are in demand from other developing countries which face similar problems.  In addition, Brazil’s natural resources and the ecosystem services they provide (tropical forest, arable land, freshwater, agricultural products) are globally significant.  Brazil has the potential to promote a much cleaner, more sustainable model of development to low income countries (LICs) than that offered by traditional donors, providing real experience on ways that LICs can minimise the environmental impact of their growth.  So what is Brazil doing to meet demands for its experience? It is keen to help and sees development cooperation as an important element of its growing global profile.  But it does not want simply to be part of a traditional donor \"club\". It prides itself on promoting a distinctive model of \"horizontal\" partnership through solidarity, based on equal south-south partnerships.",

    "description": "In March 2011, DFID closed its bilateral aid programme to China. Our relationship with China now identifies ways in which both countries can work together as partners on shared global development objectives, global public goods and poverty reduction.  **UK-China Global Development Partnership**  The UK Government has made forging alliances with the “Emerging Powers” a foreign and international development policy priority. China, by far the largest and fastest-growing emerging economy, is at the forefront of this effort. China provides substantial aid, trade and investment to the developing world and is a major force on practically all global development issues. China’s impact is felt both through its direct impact in developing countries and through its increasingly active role in global debates and policy-making processes.  China is home to 70% of those lifted out of poverty worldwide between 1985 and 2010 – experience which may hold crucial lessons for other developing countries. As the world’s second-largest investor in research and development, China has enormous capacity for delivering new low- and high-tech, low-cost solutions to global development challenges. And as a major trade partner and source of investment for the developing world, working with China on the drivers of economic growth in developing countries has great potential.   The UK and China established a new Global Development Partnership in 2011, following the closure of the UK’s bilateral aid programme in China. As the first international aid agency to start working with China in this way, DFID is breaking new ground both for our own organisation and internationally. We believe that we can do more for the world’s poor by combining our respective strengths, sharing expertise and unlocking innovative new solutions.   **Key sectors and programmes** DFID is working with China to develop a range of programmes and dialogues to achieve these objectives. In places, our cooperation may include pilots in third countries - if requested by the third country and agreed by all parties.  **Agriculture and food security:** improving food security in low-income countries, through accelerated technology transfer and knowledge sharing. Combining best practice from China and the UK our aim is to improve food security through increasing production in low-income countries in Africa and Asia, through three areas of work: technology transfer through demonstrations and piloting activities; collaborative research to enhance agricultural innovation in low income countries; and sharing of innovative solutions to food security challenges with policy makers and agricultural practitioners.  **Disaster Risk Reduction:** increasing resilience to disasters in developing countries in Asia, by strengthening regional cooperation on community-based disaster management. Asia is the world’s most disaster-prone region, according to the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. On average, disasters caused over 65,000 deaths in Asia and affected almost 220 million people each year between 2002 and 2011. We are providing opportunities for experts from the UK, China and other developing countries to exchange experience and training on disaster management, strengthening the evidence base on how best to improve disaster management and facilitating community-level visits and pilots on disaster management. The first phase of this project focuses on Bangladesh and Nepal.  **Global health:** improving global health policy and outcomes, through UK-China collaboration including pilot partnerships in LICs and increased contribution to global health issues. Our work in this area aims to build capacity for DFID and low-income countries to learn from China’s unparalleled success in decreasing infant, child and maternal mortality rates and from China’s recent health sector reform programme. The capacity built and lessons learned will contribute to the development of pilot partnerships between China and low-income countries to strengthen health systems and improve health outcomes. We also plan to work with China on access to medicines through a project which will improve China’s contribution to the supply of quality active pharmaceutical ingredients, formulations and other essential health commodities where they are needed to address public health priorities in low-income countries.  **Trade:** implementing joint UK-China projects and policy changes that strengthen African trade performance, through development and adoption of a long-term framework for UK-China collaboration on trade for African development. China and the UK share a common objective to help low income countries, particularly in Africa, to accelerate growth and job creation through increasing trade. And both countries place growing emphasis on aid for trade, particularly for Africa. We are conducting joint UK/China research to assess how trade, investment and aid-for-trade from China and the UK can most effectively support growth and poverty reduction in Africa. We will also continue to engage in dialogue with China on opportunities and priorities for practical collaboration on promoting African trade.  **Investment:** increasing sustainable and poverty-reducing investment in DFID priority countries, through improving the quality of Chinese outward investment in developing countries. Chinese companies and banks are a major and rapidly growing source of investment and financing in developing countries including many DFID priority countries. DFID recently signed a memorandum of understanding with China Development Bank, one of the largest sources of finance in the developing world, under which we aim to enhance the impact, quality and sustainability of investments made by China and the UK in Africa.",

    "description": "Dominica is a volcanic island in the eastern Caribbean. It has a population of around 70,000, and an economy heavily dependent on tourism and agriculture.   In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015.  As part of this, Dominica will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters. Most people in the Caribbean live close to the coast, vulnerable to the threats of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. UK aid will provide training and practical measures across the Caribbean such as safer buildings and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers, to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.  We are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and to integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions. Knowing what problems they face will make it easier for them to make a case for action, mobilise resources to scale up their efforts and ensure development gains are not lost.  The UK is also a major contributor to the global Pilot Programme on Climate Change which has allocated around £40 million to develop climate resilience programmes for Dominica and five other Caribbean countries.   In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:  £10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets.  £10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union.  CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors  £4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.  CARTFund is helping Dominica's service industries to organise themselves into a national coalition, so that they can sell more services both domestically and in export markets.  COMPETE Caribbean is reviewing Dominica's existing strategy for promoting greater economic growth, by developing a five-year framework for growth and poverty reduction.  The Dominica financial sector also benefits from DFID's £600,000 contribution to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, to help it regulate the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.    In common with the rest of the Caribbean, Dominica suffers from the effects of organised crime. We are training and equipping law enforcement agencies, courts and special intelligence units in the eastern Caribbean to investigate organised crime, confiscate criminal assets and reduce money laundering.  The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2009, UK contributions that benefited Dominica amounted to £466,000.",

Bordering the Red Sea, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Sudan, the country of Eritrea, with its mountainous terrain and coastal plains, is one of the most picturesque countries in East Africa.  But it remains one of the poorest countries in the world.  Eritrea ranks 165 out of 182 on the UN Human Development Index.  Life expectancy is 59 years but HIV prevalence remains below 2%. The government has put substantial effort into improving health, education and clean water and hygiene provision, but many challenges still remain.  Water shortage is a major difficulty for Eritrea; it has endured consecutive years of drought, leading to serious humanitarian problems such as food insecurity and severe malnutrition in children.  ## DFID activity in Eritrea:  - DFID’s Eritrea programme team is based in London with support from Nairobi. - It works closely with the British Embassy in Asmara, international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and multilateral organisations such as the UN.",

With the advent of a new Government in the UK, a thorough review was undertaken of all DFID's bilateral aid programmes, with the aim of focusing UK assistance where it can have the greatest possible impact. This review has endorsed the closure of the Gambia programme as announced in 2008.  The decision to close our programme in the Gambia was agreed with the Government of Gambia in 2008 and our office closed then. We have since been winding down the programme which is due to close in 2011. The decision was taken to wind down the programme gradually as part of a responsible exit to help sustainability of project outputs and ensure partners build on successful DFID programmes.  The UK will also continue to support the Gambia through the UK's increasing share of World Bank, African Development Bank, European Commission and other multilateral programming.",

    "description": "Grenada, in the eastern Caribbean, consists of the island of Grenada and six smaller islands, with a total population of around 105,000.  In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015.  As part of this, Grenada will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters. Most people in the Caribbean live close to the coast, vulnerable to the threats of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. DFID is helping vulnerable people to be better prepared and equipped to withstand these threats, which are expected to get worse. Coastal environments are at particular risk from climate change, and we are supporting work in 15 marine-protected areas across the Caribbean, including in Grenada, to protect and improve fish stocks and coral reefs. This work should provide new employment opportunities for local people and introduce new systems for government, fisherfolk and the local community to jointly manage marine sanctuaries.  The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited Grenada amounted to £797,000.  Grenada is highly prone to natural disasters - in 2004, the cost of damage from Hurricane Ivan was more than 253% of the country's income that year. UK aid will help ensure safer buildings and and better preparedness across the Caribbean in the future. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers, to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.  We are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and to integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions, for example through a climate change risk atlas for Grenada's tourism sector and an economic impact assessment of climate change on the water sector. Knowing what problems they face will make it easier for them to make a case for action, mobilise resources to scale up their efforts and ensure development gains are not lost.  The UK is also a major contributor to the global Pilot Programme on Climate Change which has allocated around £40 million to develop climate resilience programmes for Grenada and five other Caribbean countries.    In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:  £10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets  £10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union.  CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors  £4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.  Under CARTFund, we are helping public agencies put legislation in place to implement the trade agreement with Europe, as well as helping the private sector to understand the agreement so that they can capitalise on opportunities to export more to Europe and get more investment  Grenada's financial sector also benefits from DFID's £600,000 contribution to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, to help it regulate the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.   In common with the rest of the Caribbean, Grenada suffers from the effects of organised crime. We are training and equipping law enforcement agencies, courts and special intelligence units in the eastern Caribbean to investigate organised crime, confiscate criminal assets and reduce money laundering.",

    "description": "Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere. It has a population of just over 10.1 million and 54% of them live on less than a dollar a day. Haiti is prone to the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes. It also suffers from economic and political instability.  We continue to support Haiti through our contributions to agencies like the United Nations, European Union and World Bank. Our share of their commitments is about £70 million in 2012 (including UN peacekeeping operations).  We have also allocated nearly £3 million to make sure reconstruction reduces future disaster risks. This includes £1 million through the Pan American Health Organisation and the Global Fund for Disaster Risk Reduction, to help the Haitian Government ensure that new hospitals and health facilities are resilient to future disasters.  In January 2010, a major earthquake devastated the capital, Port-au-Prince. Around 222,000 people died, and more than 300,000 were seriously injured; 1.5 million people needed emergency shelter and over 190,000 buildings were destroyed or damaged beyond repair.  DFID provided support immediately after the earthquake and again in late 2010 to fight cholera. This helped to reach a million people with food, shelter, clean water and medical care - including 200,000 people with cholera treatment and prevention.  With £873,000 from DFID, the international NGO ACTED (Agency for Technical Co-operation and Development) made structural assessments of over 14,500 earthquake-damaged buildings and repaired 300 houses so families could return home.  We have also helped to develop \"MiCRO\", an innovative hazard insurance scheme, for Fonkoze, Haiti's largest micro-finance institution, which has 50,000 members, most of them women. In June 2011, the scheme approved a payout of $2 million to Fonkoze members in areas worst hit by heavy rains. Information on Fonkoze can be found at:  http://www.fonkoze.org.  Haiti also benefits from our regional programmes for the Caribbean, which will amount to £75 million over the period 2011 until 2015.  The UK is also a major contributor to the global Pilot Programme on Climate Change which has allocated around £40 million to develop climate resilience programmes for Haiti and five other Caribbean countries.    In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:  £10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets  £10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union.  CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors  £4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.",

    "code": "JM",
    "name": "Jamaica",
    "description": "Jamaica is the largest English-speaking country in the Caribbean, with a population of nearly 2.8 million. Jamaica benefits from DFID's regional programmes for the Caribbean, and - because of its size and the particular challenges it faces - it also receives direct support to promote economic growth and reduce crime.  In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015.  This includes direct support for Jamaica, as well as programmes that benefit the whole region.  Jamaica is very heavily indebted. Since 1998, DFID has provided over £66 million in debt relief to Jamaica, as well as over £1 million of training and other support to improve debt management by the Government of Jamaica. This meant that Jamaica paid considerably less in interest payments last year.  The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited Jamaica amounted to £2,614,000.  With few opportunities, and unemployment in these communities as high as 38%, many young men feel that joining a gang and entering a life of crime is the only option. Through our £7.5 million contribution to the Citizen Security and Justice Programme, in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank, we are helping to transform 50 of Jamaica's most violent criminally-controlled communities into normal neighbourhoods.  Jamaica's inner cities are amongst the most violent in the world - with many communities controlled by criminals rather than the state. Everyday services, like reliable water supplies, rubbish collection and sanitation are not regularly provided, so people have no choice but to rely on criminal gangs to provide their basic services.  Over the next four years, 142,000 people will gain a reliable water supply and have their rubbish collected by the state, instead of depending on local gang leaders. We will help provide training and legitimate employment opportunities for at least 13,000 people.  In Jamaica, many police officers have been involved in violent or organised crime. This has resulted in a vicious cycle of worsening crime, and  people are reluctant to co-operate with the police. We recently completed a £3.7 million programme of support to the Jamaica Constabulary Force that has helped to change the culture of the police force. Police officers know that there is zero tolerance of corruption from now on – their careers depend on it. Since 2008, around 300 officers have been arrested for corruption, and a further 250 have been dismissed. Over time, this will mean a safer Jamaica. A new £7.5 million programme to improve police efficiency and accountability started in March 2012.  Jamaica will also benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare for and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters. Most people in the Caribbean live close to the coast, vulnerable to storms, flooding and rising sea levels. DFID is helping people to be better prepared and equipped to withstand these threats. UK aid will provide training at community level by the Red Cross in Jamaica, as well as practical measures such as safer buildings, improved water management and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers, to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.  Being prepared is critical to reducing damage from disasters. We are helping Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean plan ahead for possible disasters and integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions, for example through national climate change risk atlases. DFID has also supported studies to assess the possible economic impact of climate change on the agricultural, health and tourism in Jamaica.   Coastal environments are at particular risk from climate change, and we are supporting work at ten of Jamaica's marine-protected areas to protect and improve fish stocks and coral reefs. This work should provide new employment opportunities for about 3,000 local people and introduce new systems for government, fisherfolk and the local community to jointly manage marine sanctuaries.     The UK is also a major contributor to the global Pilot Programme on Climate Change which has allocated around £40 million to develop climate resilience programmes for Jamaica and five other Caribbean countries.    In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:  £10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets  £10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union. CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors  £4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.  Through CARTFund, we are helping the Jamaica Coalition of Service Industries to increase exports in the main service sectors such as health, education, entertainment, communications technology, finance and insurance, and accounting and auditing. This includes assistance in implementing a marketing strategy for exploiting export opportunities in these sectors. We are also helping the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica gain greater market access for Jamaican goods and services under CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), as well as helping member firms to take advantage of export opportunities with the European Union.    COMPETE is improving the effectiveness of Jamaican investment attraction programmes by implementing reforms that simplify business processes. It is also stimulating community economic development in Kingston, by identifying the main bottlenecks hampering local development and creating an action plan to address them.",

The economic base is narrow, fragile and dependent on remittances (which represented 35% of GDP in 2012), trade and transit. Social indicators are poor. Ethnic tension, often mobilised by political par ties and other groupings, has periodically derailed economic growth. The national poverty rate has reduced to 38%, but with negligible improvement since 2009. Economic and democratic gains have not been consolidated and risk reversal. After the 2010 revolution the Kyrgyz Republic established a Parliamentary Democracy, the only one in the former Soviet Central Asia. Political parties are not yet sufficiently familiar with this model to make it work efficiently. Robust debate and challenge between parties and factions within Parliament has contributed to delays in enacting much needed reforms.  ## Top priorities * promote stability and development through improved and more transparent public finance management, including anti-corruption activities, which will drive better delivery of social services * providing advice to parliamentarians on how to operate effectively within the fledgling parliamentary democracy and to hold government better to account for delivery of benefits to citizens * support for an improved business regulatory environment to encourage private sector investment and generate jobs  ## Further resources [DFID Operational Plan for Central Asia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfids-regional-programme-in-central-asia-operational-plan-2013)  [Kyrgyzstan page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/kyrgyzstan)",

With elections due in 2017, President Sirleaf’s 2 terms (a total of 12 years) will end and it will be critical to see whether a smooth transition can be made from post war society to a low-income but politically stable one.   ## Top priorities * infrastructure rehabilitation focused on roads, water, sanitation and hygiene and solid waste management * reforming the health sector * future focus of DFID’s bilateral programme will be infrastructure, natural resources, revenue mobilisation and economic empowerment of girls and women  ## Further resources [DFID Operational Plan for Liberia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-liberia-operational-plan-2013)  [Liberia page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/liberia)",

The OPTs are one of the poorest parts of the region with a GDP per capita of $1,679 in 2012. After several years of high growth, averaging 8% between 2007 and 2011, the Palestinian economy has slowed. Lack of meaningful progress in the MEPP and continuing movement and access restrictions have dampened private sector investment.

It is situated in the South Atlantic 1,200 miles off the West African coast.  The island has limited natural resources and the economy is typical of small islands with high import dependency, a non-diversified economic base, a large public sector and outmigration.  The UK Government’s aim in St Helena is to provide basic services to its people while supporting the island to become self-sufficient and eventually graduate from aid.  UK direct budgetary aid provides around half of St Helena Government’s recurrent budget the rest coming from local island revenues.  Budgetary aid helps fund the delivery of basic public services such as health care, education and social security for the poorest households.  UK funding also maintains safe and reliable maritime access by subsidising the operation of the Royal Mail Ship St Helena and our funds build capacity in key sectors for the island’s future, such as, tourism, infrastructure and inward investment.    In November 2011, the UK Government agreed to fund an airport.  Construction is underway and flights will begin in early 2016. Air access is the best way to improve the island’s long term development prospects and will have a dramatic impact on the island community, bringing a period of accelerated social and economic change.  The St Helena Government has embarked on a programme of far reaching reforms to open its economy up for tourism and to encourage greater levels of inward investment.  These reforms are designed to make the most of the opportunities air access will bring and, ultimately, to make the island a more attractive place to live, invest, work and to visit.    ## Further resources [DFID Operational Plan for British Overseas Territories](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-british-overseas-territories-operational-plan-2013)  [St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/st-helena-ascension-and-tristan-da-cunha)",

In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015. As part of this, St Kitts and Nevis will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare for and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters.  The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited St Kitts and Nevis amounted to £1,318,000.  Most people in the Caribbean live less than a mile from the coast and are vulnerable to the threats of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. DFID is helping vulnerable people across the region to be better prepared and equipped to withstand these threats, which are expected to get worse.  UK aid will provide training, as well as practical measures such as safer buildings and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance to protect the assets and livelihoods of small businesses and farmers when disaster strikes.  We are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and to integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions, for example through a study to assess the economic impact of climate change on the country's coastal and marine sector, and a climate change risk atlas for the tourism sector in St Kitts.   Knowing what problems they might face will make it easier to make a case for action, to mobilise resources to scale up their efforts, and to ensure development gains are not lost.   In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:  £10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets  £10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union. CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors  £4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.  In St Kitts and Nevis, COMPETE is financing the cost of a plan to make the private sector more competitive. Under CARTFund, we are helping public agencies put legislation in place to implement a trade agreement with Europe, as well as helping the private sector to understand the agreement so that they capitalise on opportunities to export more to Europe and get more investment.  The economy of St Kitts and Nevis has been in decline for a few years and the national debt has grown rapidly. DFID has provided the St Kitts and Nevis Government with an adviser from the International Monetary Fund to improve the Finance Ministry's macro-economic management systems.  The St Kitts and Nevis financial sector also benefits from DFID's £600,000 contribution to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, to help it regulate the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.  In common with the rest of the Caribbean, St Kitts and Nevis suffers from the effects of organised crime. We are training and equipping law enforcement agencies, courts and special intelligence units in the eastern Caribbean to investigate organised crime, confiscate criminal assets and reduce money laundering.",

Its economy depends mainly on tourism and banana exports, with some small-scale manufacturing.  In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015.  As part of this, St Lucia will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare for and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters.  The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited St Lucia amounted to £124,000.  Most people in the Caribbean live close to the coast, vulnerable to the threats of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. When a hurricane hit St Lucia in 2010, 80% of the banana crop was wiped out, with a devastating impact on farmers' livelihoods. The health and water sectors were also badly hit, and there was significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. DFID provided assistance through the Pan-American Health Organisation to help restore health services, provide clean water and avoid disease epidemics after the hurricane.   DFID is helping vulnerable people across the Caribbean to be better prepared and equipped to withstand these threats, which are expected to get worse. UK aid will provide training, as well as practical measures such as safer buildings, improved water management and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance to protect the livelihoods and assets of small businesses and farmers when disaster strikes.   We are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and the impact of climate change - for example through a climate change risk atlas and studies to assess the economics of climate change in the agricultural, health and tourism sectors in St Lucia. Knowing the problems they might face will make it easier to make a case for action, mobilise resources to scale up their efforts and ensure development gains are not lost.    The UK is also a major contributor to the global Pilot Programme on Climate Change which has allocated around £40 million to develop climate resilience programmes for St Lucia and five other Caribbean countries.  DFID also supports the development of innovative new renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, such as a bio-ethanol project in St Lucia which converts waste bananas into ethanol for fuel.  In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:  £10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets  £10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union.  CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors  £4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission.

The St Lucia financial sector also benefits from DFID's £600,000 contribution to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, to help it regulate the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.  In common with the rest of the Caribbean, St Lucia suffers from the effects of organised crime. We are training and equipping law enforcement agencies, courts and special intelligence units in the Eastern Caribbean to investigate organised crime, confiscate criminal assets and reduce money laundering.",

    "description": "St Vincent and the Grenadines is made up of the main island, St Vincent, and a chain of smaller islands in the eastern Caribbean.  It has a population of nearly 110,000, and its economy relies heavily on the exportation of bananas and on tourism.  In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015.  As part of this, St Vincent and the Grenadines will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare for and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters.  The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited St Vincent and the Grenades amounted to £202,000.  Most people in the Caribbean live close to the coast, vulnerable to the threats of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. DFID is helping vulnerable people accross the region to be better prepared and equipped to withstand these threats, which are expected to get worse. UK aid will provide training, as well as practical measures such as safer buildings and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.   We are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and the impact of climate change, for example through a study to assess the economic impact of climate change on the water sector in St Vincent and the Grenadines. Knowing what problems they might face will make it easier to make a case for action, mobilise resources to scale up their efforts and ensure development gains are not lost.    The UK is also a major contributor to the global Pilot Programme on Climate Change which has allocated around £40 million to develop climate resilience programmes for St Vincent and the Grenadines and five other Caribbean countries.    DFID supports the development of innovative new renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. One such project from St Vincent and the Grenadines is the web-based social networking 'W-electricity' application to promote energy efficiency and which now has registered users from over 87 countries.  St Vincent and the Grenadines is still recovering from 2010's Hurricane Tomas. As part of this recovery, DFID supported work through the Pan-American Health Organisation to help restore health services, provide clean water and prevent disease epidemics.  The illegal cultivation of cannabis is increasing in the country, and St Vincent now faces a high level of crime associated with illegal drug trading. Organised criminal groups are taking advantage of weaknesses in the police and judiciary in the eastern Caribbean to continue their operations unfettered. In response to this growing threat, DFID is assisting local financial investigation units to investigate cases and seize the funds and assets of drug dealers. By 2011, assets valued at over £5 million had been restrained by the courts, and £1.4 million in cash had been seized and was awaiting forfeiture.   In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:  £10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets  £10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union.  CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors  £4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.  The St Vincent financial sector also benefits from DFID's £600,000 contribution to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, to help it regulate the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.   In common with the rest of the Caribbean, St Vincent and the Grenadines suffers from the effects of organised crime.

Since independence on 9 July 2011, the new country has struggled with huge development challenges. Decades of war have left a legacy of chronic poverty, inequality, and limited capacity and infrastructure. The first part of 2013 saw some initial progress towards establishing a more development focused approach. That progress was reversed by the outbreak of conflict. Since the start of the violence, thousands of people have been killed, and over 1 million have fled their homes, including to neighbouring countries. Despite the signing of a cessation of hostilities agreement, fighting has continued. By April 2014, 4.9 million people were in urgent need of humanitarian aid. In late 2013–14 the UK developed an interim strategy in response to the conflict. This reflects a shift from ‘business as usual’.  ## Top priorities * humanitarian response and strengthening resilience, particularly in the area of food security * basic services in health and education, supporting the most vulnerable, especially women and girls * focused work on governance where we can support reconciliation and peacebuilding * underpin all programmes with a strong focus on conflict sensitivity  ## Further resources [DFID Operational Plan for South Sudan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-south-sudan-operational-plan-2014)  [South Sudan page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/south-sudan)",

    "description": "Sri Lanka is a middle income country. DFID's bilateral programme in the country closed in 2006 when Sri Lanka graduated to middle income status. However, DFID still contributes to Sri Lanka through the Conflict Prevention Fund (£2 million in 2010/11).  Long running civil war has been a major cause of poverty and inequality in Sri Lanka. In May 2009, the 26 year long conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) came to an end following the defeat of the LTTE. The challenge ahead is to prevent a return to conflict and encourage equitable development in the north.  In response to needs on the ground, DFID has committed £13.5 million of humanitarian funding to Sri Lanka since September 2008.  The end of the conflict in May 2009 created almost 280,00 internally displaced people (IDPs). The majority of these remained detained in camps in the north of Sri Lanka until October 2009 when the Government started a 'crash' returns programme to return them to their homes.",

    "description": "Sudan is a failing state. The country suffers from chronic underdevelopment following cycles of conflict over the last 5 decades. In 2013, the conflicts within Sudan’s borders intensified, and early 2014 has seen the worst humanitarian situation in Darfur since the star t of the conflict 10 years ago. At least 6.1 million people are judged to be in need of humanitarian assistance across the country. The recent crisis in South Sudan has also led to an influx of refugees in the southern border states of Sudan. The country is experiencing political stalemate, and the federal government undermines democratic and accountable governance and drives inequality, focusing its spending on Khartoum to the neglect of peripheral states. Sudan is off track on the majority of the MDGs.  ## Top priorities * providing protection and life-saving humanitarian support to people affected by conflict, while building the resilience of communities to cope with shocks * improving sustainable access to basic services such as water and sanitation for the most vulnerable * helping vulnerable people to cope with economic instability, such as price increases and cuts to government spending * investing in the private sector and civil society, to lay the foundations for a more democratic, peaceful and prosperous future  ## Further resources [DFID Operational Plan for Sudan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-sudan-operational-plan-2014)  [Sudan page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/sudan)",

In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015. As part of this, Suriname will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare for and reduce the risk from climate change and natural disasters.   The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited Suriname amounted to £2,013,000.  We are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and to integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions, for example through a climate change risk atlas in Suriname. Knowing what problems they might face will make it easier for them to make a case for action, mobilise resources to scale up their efforts and ensure development gains are not lost. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.  Many people in Suriname live close to the coast, or in places that are vulnerable to the threat of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. UK aid will provide training at community level through the Red Cross, as well as practical measures such as safer buildings and improved water management. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers across the Caribbean to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.  In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:  £10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets. COMPETE Caribbean is providing US$500,000  to improve Suriname’s investment climate, by prioritising and implementing reforms needed to boost economic growth and diversify the economy.  £10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union. CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors. In Suriname, the programme has provided US$403,590 to help increase community-based tourism and other economic initiatives among the indigenous population.   £4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.",

In Syria, UK support is helping to deliver emergency food aid to 80,000 people a month, shelter for 9,000 families, and urgent medical care for at least 50,000 people across Syria and the region.  The UK has recently announced a further £9 million to support the UN response in Syria and the region, bringing the total UK support to £39.5 million.  We are also helping refugees in neighbouring countries. UK funding will help to provide trauma support and education for 28,000 children, emergency food rations for over 18,000 people, drinking water, sanitation and hygiene for over 33,000 refugees and basic supplies for mothers and babies.  The UK remains at the forefront of international efforts to support an effective response, led by the UN. We are the second largest bi-lateral donor of international humanitarian aid to the Syrian perople.  ## Facts and stats * Total UK humanitarian funding for the response to the Syria crisis is £39.5m to date; £21.5m to meet needs in Syria and £18m for refugees in neighbouring countries. * Our humanitarian assistance is provided through neutral and impartial agencies and is wholly separate from UK support for the opposition. * All UK funding is going to humanitarian agencies with a proven ability to operate in Syria.  ## Further resources [DFID Operational Plan for Syria](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-syria-operational-plan-2014)  [Syria page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/syria \"Syria page on GOV.UK website\")",

These gains are, however, at risk: economic growth and poverty reduction have been driven by migrant workers in Russia, who contributed 47% of GDP in 2012. The Russian economy is, however, slowing and labour opportunities and remittances are unlikely to be sustained at current levels. The small private sector is not creating adequate revenues or job opportunities to offset the relative decline in remittances. Tajikistan is unlikely to achieve the 9% growth rate needed to keep pace with the burgeoning population. Health and education provision is deteriorating.

But acute challenges remain: 21 million people live below the international poverty line; and the country ranks 151 on the Human Development Index.   ## Top priorities for 2020 * **Strengthening global peace, security and governance:** Democracy in Tanzania will be further entrenched with a strengthened parliament, civil society and media. Government systems will be more able to engage with citizens and deliver against their priorities, including tackling organised crime. And Tanzania’s partnership with HMRC will continue to drive increases in domestic revenue. (Global Goals 15, 16 and 17) * **Strengthening resilience and response to crises:** Renewables, including off-grid household solar, will be a major source of energy. The impact of climate change, particularly in cities, will be reduced. The suffering of refugee populations will be reduced during protracted crises, particularly Burundi. (Global Goals 7, 11 and 13) * **Promoting global prosperity:** Tanzania will have taken significant steps both to realise the demographic dividend through job creation and to manage the growth of its cities, pre-empting youth grievance. The most vulnerable and disadvantaged will have greater income opportunities. (Global Goals 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15.) * **Tackling extreme poverty and helping the world’s most vulnerable:** The number of Tanzanians in extreme poverty and suffering from malnutrition will be dramatically reduced. There will be a step-change in the quality of education, access to clean water and sanitation, and girls and women will have more voice, choice and control over their lives.

Economic growth was approximately 6% in 2013–14, and planned public sector infrastructure investment is expected to boost growth fur ther to 6.5% in 2014–15. Uganda’s debt continues to be sustainable; however, its revenue to GDP ratio (estimated at 13.7% for 2013–14) remains the lowest in east Africa. Despite high headline growth rates over the last 2 decades, much of this growth has not translated into adequate employment through decent jobs. With high population growth, levels of youth unemployment are increasing. Uganda’s policy framework for social services is strong. It prioritises equitable access to quality social services; however, policies are often not well implemented. Governance trends are concerning and corruption is endemic. In 2013, the UK decided to indefinitely suspend budget support to the Government of Uganda following the 2012 corruption scandal in the office of the Prime Minister.  ## Top priorities * promoting good governance and combating corruption  * improving maternal and reproductive health * supporting economic development and growth including youth skills and job creation * increasing access to financial services and regional trade * protecting the poorest and most vulnerable  ## Further resources [DFID Operational Plan for Uganda](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-uganda-operational-plan-2014)  [Uganda page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/uganda)",

DFID’s programme includes improving the Government of Zambia’s policies, systems and skills, enabling Zambia to increase its tax take and use its resources to deliver better services.
