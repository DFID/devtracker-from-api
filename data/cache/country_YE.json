{"updatedDate":"2024-03-04","data":{"code":"YE","name":"Yemen","description":"The UK is supporting efforts to bring all parties back to the negotiating table to achieve an inclusive political solution that delivers a peaceful future for the people of Yemen. Reducing conflict will ease the humanitarian crisis and allow the government and partners to focus on reconstruction and development. FCDO is leading the international community to do more to respond to the Yemen crisis. This includes working with UN agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other donors, to respond to urgent humanitarian needs, including the risk of a renewed cholera outbreak. By providing lifesaving humanitarian support; working with legitimate organisations to deliver basic services; providing an opportunity for the poor to secure paid work; and coordinating with the UN and other donors, UK aid is supporting the most vulnerable, helping to build resilience and doing this as effectively and efficiently as possible. The UK Government will continue to provide direct support to the UN Special Envoy’s team, including to facilitate an effective and inclusive peace process. We are supporting UN Women to bring women’s voices - and those of other under-represented groups - into the political process.  \n\n[FCDO Profile](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-yemen-profile-july-2018)","population":26832215,"population_year":"","lifeExpectancy":63.81819512,"incomeLevel":"Lower middle income","belowPovertyLine":"","belowPovertyLine_year":"","fertilityRate":4.16,"fertilityRate_year":2014,"gdpGrowthRate":-28.09683489,"gdpGrowthRate_year":2015,"countryBudget":87716941.2617521,"countryBudgetCurrency":"GBP"}}
