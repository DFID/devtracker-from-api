{"updatedDate":"2023-08-01","data":{"code":"NG","name":"Nigeria","description":"Nigeria is Africa’s biggest country by population and its second largest economy. It has the world’s 10th largest proven oil reserves and the 9th largest natural gas reserves. The UK-Nigeria trade relationship was worth £4 billion in 2015 and has the potential to grow significantly in the future. Nigeria is therefore a significant trade and investment partner for the UK in Africa. However, Nigeria faces a number of challenges to its future growth and development. Conflict continues to affect its oil-rich delta region and there is a violent Islamist insurgency in its north-east which has caused a humanitarian crisis. Despite significant natural resources, around a third of Nigerians (60 million) live below the national poverty line with around another third just above; many of them are highly vulnerable and at risk of being trafficked to the UK. The government of Nigeria is taking the lead to tackle these issues, but struggles with corruption, as well as the necessary capacity and resources. The UK is focused on helping Nigeria overcome these challenges.  \n\n[FCDO Profile](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/723246/DFID-Nigeria-Profile-July-2018.pdf)","population":182201962,"population_year":2015,"lifeExpectancy":52.75426829,"incomeLevel":"Lower middle income","belowPovertyLine":53.47,"belowPovertyLine_year":2009,"fertilityRate":5.65,"fertilityRate_year":2014,"gdpGrowthRate":2.652693623,"gdpGrowthRate_year":2015,"countryBudget":129174215.43285714,"countryBudgetCurrency":"GBP"}}
