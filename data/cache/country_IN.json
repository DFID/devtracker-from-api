{"updatedDate":"2023-08-02","data":{"code":"IN","name":"India","description":"India is an important economic partner for the UK. It will become even more important as it consolidates its position as a major global power. India is one of the fastest growing major economies and is projected to become the world’s third largest economy by 2030. The UK is the largest G20 investor in India, while India invests more in the UK than in the rest of the EU combined. India is crucial for co-operation in international bodies like the United Nations, World Bank and World Trade Organisation. The UK and India share common values on rights and freedoms, and together can be a force for good on global issues. India is constrained in reaching its full global economic and political potential by significant internal challenges, including some 230 million people living in poverty; skills shortages; unplanned urbanisation; and a huge infrastructure deficit. Our partnership with India helps enhance investment and trade; increase prosperity and jobs in both countries; strengthen joint action on global issues of mutual concern; widen access to knowledge and technology and support the UK’s global security objectives. Our targeted and catalytic support is designed to help India address its constraints to growth, accelerate development for the good of all its people and generate a return for Britain by creating new markets for trade and investment.  \n\n[FCDO Profile](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-india-profile-july-2018)","population":1311050527,"population_year":2015,"lifeExpectancy":68.01380488,"incomeLevel":"Lower middle income","belowPovertyLine":21.23,"belowPovertyLine_year":2011,"fertilityRate":2.427,"fertilityRate_year":2014,"gdpGrowthRate":7.56336718,"gdpGrowthRate_year":2015,"countryBudget":28578966.74285714,"countryBudgetCurrency":"GBP"}}
