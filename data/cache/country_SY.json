{"updatedDate":"2023-08-01","data":{"code":"SY","name":"Syria","description":"The conflict in Syria poses serious risks to UK interests, including the stability of the wider region, migration, and counter-terrorism. FCDO plays an important role in delivering the UK’s overall strategy which seeks to end the conflict and bring about an inclusive political settlement that will reduce these risks. FCDO’s investment to meet humanitarian needs and to strengthen Syrians’ ability to withstand the impact of the conflict is both the right thing to do and is in the UK’s national interest. Turkey now hosts the highest number of refugees in the world including 3.6 million Syrians. FCDO’s support provides refugees and Turkish host communities with essential services and support. This assists Turkey in absorbing the burden of such a large number of refugees and helps to create the conditions that mean refugees are less likely to fall prey to people smugglers and attempt the perilous journey to Europe. Preventing irregular migration to Europe and the UK is in the UK’s national interest.  \n\n[FCDO Profile](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/723627/Syria-Profile-July-2018.pdf)","population":18502413,"population_year":2015,"lifeExpectancy":70.07102439,"incomeLevel":"Lower middle income","belowPovertyLine":"","belowPovertyLine_year":"","fertilityRate":2.95,"fertilityRate_year":2014,"gdpGrowthRate":5.699999996,"gdpGrowthRate_year":2007,"countryBudget":87397616.70285714,"countryBudgetCurrency":"GBP"}}
