The OPTs are one of the poorest parts of the region with a GDP per capita of $1,679 in 2012. After several years of high growth, averaging 8% between 2007 and 2011, the Palestinian economy has slowed. Lack of meaningful progress in the MEPP and continuing movement and access restrictions have dampened private sector investment. The situation in Gaza is particularly concerning with the economy shrinking by 17% in the 6 years to 2011. A quarter of Palestinians are currently unemployed and only 15% of women are in the labour force.  \n\n## Top priorities \n* helping the Palestinian Authority to build strong institutions and enable them to deliver essential services including policing, health and education \n* promoting private sector growth to stimulate the economy and create jobs \n* providing humanitarian assistance and support to the vulnerable  \n\n## Further resources \n[FCDO Operational Plan for Occupied Palestinian Territories](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-palestinian-programme-operational-plan-2014)  \n[Occupied Palestinian Territories page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/the-occupied-palestinian-territories)","population":4422143,"population_year":2015,"lifeExpectancy":72.90402439,"incomeLevel":"Lower middle income","belowPovertyLine":0.11,"belowPovertyLine_year":2009,"fertilityRate":4.176,"fertilityRate_year":2014,"gdpGrowthRate":12.39324292,"gdpGrowthRate_year":2015,"countryBudget":87287922.64295211,"countryBudgetCurrency":"GBP"}}
