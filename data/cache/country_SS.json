{"updatedDate":"2024-03-04","data":{"code":"SS","name":"South Sudan","description":"The outbreak of conflict in December 2013 in Juba and subsequently elsewhere in the country was disastrous for South Sudan. Since independence on 9 July 2011, the new country has struggled with huge development challenges. Decades of war have left a legacy of chronic poverty, inequality, and limited capacity and infrastructure. The first part of 2013 saw some initial progress towards establishing a more development focused approach. That progress was reversed by the outbreak of conflict. Since the start of the violence, thousands of people have been killed, and over 1 million have fled their homes, including to neighbouring countries. Despite the signing of a cessation of hostilities agreement, fighting has continued. By April 2014, 4.9 million people were in urgent need of humanitarian aid. In late 2013–14 the UK developed an interim strategy in response to the conflict. This reflects a shift from ‘business as usual’.  \n\n## Top priorities \n* humanitarian response and strengthening resilience, particularly in the area of food security \n* basic services in health and education, supporting the most vulnerable, especially women and girls \n* focused work on governance where we can support reconciliation and peacebuilding \n* underpin all programmes with a strong focus on conflict sensitivity  \n\n## Further resources \n[FCDO Operational Plan for South Sudan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-south-sudan-operational-plan-2014)  \n[South Sudan page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/south-sudan)","population":12339812,"population_year":2015,"lifeExpectancy":55.68221951,"incomeLevel":"Low income","belowPovertyLine":42.71,"belowPovertyLine_year":2009,"fertilityRate":5.022,"fertilityRate_year":2014,"gdpGrowthRate":-6.349777952,"gdpGrowthRate_year":2015,"countryBudget":62769568.352830954,"countryBudgetCurrency":"GBP"}}
