{"updatedDate":"2023-08-02","data":{"code":"RW","name":"Rwanda","description":"Rwanda has achieved significant progress since the devastating genocide of 1994. Poverty within Rwanda declined by 12% between 2005–06 and 2010–11. Yet 4.7 million people in Rwanda live below the national poverty line, of whom 2.5 million live in extreme poverty. Reliance on low income agriculture and agricultural wage labour makes the majority of poor people’s livelihoods very fragile.  In July and December 2013, the UK agreed with the Government of Rwanda to reprogramme a total of £37 million general budget support into specific sectors using government systems. These funds have been released into the education, social protection and agriculture sectors to directly support some of the poorest people in Rwanda.  \n\n## Top priorities \n* transformation from an agricultural economy to private sector-led growth \n* significantly improved services that deliver the MDGs \n* increased accountability of the state to citizens and empowerment of girls, women and the extreme poor \n* transition to more open and inclusive politics and enhanced human rights  \n\n## Further resources \n[FCDO Operational Plan for Rwanda](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-rwanda-operational-plan-2014)  \n[Rwanda page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/rwanda)","population":11609666,"population_year":2015,"lifeExpectancy":63.96565854,"incomeLevel":"Low income","belowPovertyLine":60.43,"belowPovertyLine_year":2013,"fertilityRate":3.898,"fertilityRate_year":2014,"gdpGrowthRate":6.904203115,"gdpGrowthRate_year":2015,"countryBudget":31340724.372857146,"countryBudgetCurrency":"GBP"}}
