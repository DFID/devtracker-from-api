{"updatedDate":"2023-08-01","data":{"code":"MZ","name":"Mozambique","description":"Mozambique remains one of the world’s poorest countries: it ranked 185th out of 186 in the 2013 UN Human Development Index, while 60% of Mozambicans live on less than $1.25 day and 55% below the national poverty line for basic needs.  However, Mozambique also has had one of the fastest growing economies in the world with GDP growth averaging 7% over 2001–11. The country will reach a crossroads within the next decade, with the potential to accelerate development as a result of the discovery of large coal and gas reserves. It also has excellent potential for agriculture and as a gateway country for landlocked countries.  \n\n## Top priorities \n* support basic service provision for health, education, water and sanitation \n* improve the ability of citizens to hold decision makers to account \n* drive more inclusive economic growth, ensuring that the poorest in Mozambique benefit from the potential in sectors such as agriculture and natural resources  \n\n## Further resources \n[FCDO Operational Plan for Mozambique](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-mozambique-operational-plan-2014)  \n[Mozambique page on GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/mozambique)","population":27977863,"population_year":2015,"lifeExpectancy":55.02595122,"incomeLevel":"Low income","belowPovertyLine":68.74,"belowPovertyLine_year":2008,"fertilityRate":5.359,"fertilityRate_year":2014,"gdpGrowthRate":6.609723214,"gdpGrowthRate_year":2015,"countryBudget":56784115.57285714,"countryBudgetCurrency":"GBP"}}
